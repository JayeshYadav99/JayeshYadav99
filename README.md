### Development is like participating in a hackathon with friends, it's a marathon, not a sprint. You'll have to work fast and work well together, with a good dose of creativity and a sense of humor. You'll be pushed to your limits and you'll probably end up pulling an all-nighter, but at the end of it all, you'll have something to be proud of, and a great story to tell. And if you don't win, just remember, "there's no such thing as a losing hackathon, only opportunities to learn and improve."

My name is Jayesh Yadav and I am a software developer. On my GitHub, you will find a variety of projects that I have worked on, showcasing my skills and abilities as a developer.

## Featured Projects
- **[Endless-Running-Game---Beginner](https://github.com/JayeshYadav99/Endless-Running-Game---Beginner-Project)** Are you ready to test your skills and have a good laugh at the same time? Look no further, "Avoid the Ravens" is the game for you!  
This is a JavaScript game where the player controls a character and tries to avoid obstacles represented by raven objects moving across the canvas. The game uses the canvas element to create the game board, and it uses JavaScript to update the game state and draw the game elements on the canvas.
